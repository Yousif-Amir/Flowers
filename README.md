# 🌸 Flower Classification Web App using CNN and Flask

This project is a deep learning-based image classifier that identifies different types of flowers (daisy, dandelion, rose, sunflower, tulip) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras. The trained model is deployed via a simple web interface using Flask.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yousif-Amir/flower-classifier.git
cd flower-classifier
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ and install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don’t have a `requirements.txt`, create one with the following content:

```text
tensorflow
flask
Pillow
numpy
matplotlib
```

### 3. Prepare Dataset

Ensure you have the `flowers` dataset structured like this:

```
flowers/
├── daisy/
├── dandelion/
├── rose/
├── sunflower/
└── tulip/
```

Each subdirectory should contain respective flower images.

### 4. Train the Model (Optional)

You can retrain the model using:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

> This will train and save the model as `flower_model.h5` under `Models/`.

### 5. Run the Web App

Start the Flask server with:

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open your browser and go to:
[http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The CNN model is defined as follows:

* Conv2D (32 filters) + MaxPooling
* Conv2D (64 filters) + MaxPooling
* Flatten
* Dense (128 units) + Dropout
* Output Layer: Dense(5) with Softmax activation

---

## 📸 How to Use

1. Launch the app.
2. Upload an image of a flower.
3. Get the predicted flower class and view the uploaded image.

---

## 📌 Dependencies

* TensorFlow / Keras
* Flask
* NumPy
* Pillow (PIL)
* Matplotlib (optional, for plotting training history)
